        <p>Hey, my name is Christian Wilson. I currently live in Ogden UT. I started BYU Pathway the first term of 2025.
            I took the
            fourth term off and I'm back for more. My main hobbies are going to the gym, making music, and playing
            chess. While
            making a career out of music composition would be nice, software development is a close second to that, and
            I'm hoping
            that career opportunities in this sector will help enable my music composition efforts.</p>

        <p>I live in the more metropolitan part of Northern Utah. It feels relatively quiet, with many mountaineers,
            hunters, hikers and skiiers.</p>
